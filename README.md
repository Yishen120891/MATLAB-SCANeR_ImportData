# MATLAB-SCANeR_ImportData
Import SCANeR *.txt and *.csv data to MATLAB *.mat data files.

Limitation: 
As script data and Simulink module share ExportChannel for outputing data, this program must be used with the including script file of SCANeR in order to ensure the order of ExportChannel.
~~It would be better to add this SCANeR script file in this repository.~~ Added.
